# Product Vision: muddymetrics

## Target Users
- Researchers and conservationists monitoring Ramsar wetland sites.
- Policy makers requiring automated biodiversity indicator reports.
- Data scientists developing and validating biodiversity metrics using GBIF data.

## Primary Objectives
- **Policy Evaluation:** Evaluate how well Ramsar policy goals can be monitored using open data (GBIF).
- **Global Dashboard:** Provide a dashboard of global Ramsar trends and indicator results for researchers and policymakers.
- **Workflow Standardization:** Integrate the `b3gbi` R package to standardize indicator workflows using GBIF data cubes.

## Key Features
- **Data Pipeline:** Automated pipeline for downloading and processing GBIF data cubes for defined spatial boundaries.
- **Biodiversity Indicators:** Calculation of temporal and spatial biodiversity indicators (richness, occurrence density) using `b3gbi`.
- **Visualization:** Generation of interactive or static visualizations (maps, time series plots) for each Ramsar site.
- **Reporting:** Aggregated reporting and dashboard-ready data outputs for global trend analysis.
